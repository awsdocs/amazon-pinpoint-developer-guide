# Integrating the AWS mobile SDKs or JavaScript library with your application<a name="integrate-sdk"></a>

To connect to the Amazon Pinpoint service from your web or mobile application, integrate the AWS Mobile SDKs or JavaScript library with your code\. With these resources, you can use the native programming language for your platform to issue requests to the Amazon Pinpoint API\. For example, you can add endpoints, apply custom endpoint attributes, report usage data, and more\.

For Android or iOS apps, use the AWS Mobile SDKs\. For web or mobile JavaScript applications, use the AWS Amplify JavaScript library for web and React Native\.

## Integrating the AWS mobile SDKs for Android or iOS<a name="integrate-sdk-mobile"></a>

Use AWS Amplify to integrate your app with AWS\. For iOS apps, see [Getting started](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/ios/start) in the iOS SDK documentation\. For Android apps, see [Getting started](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/android/start) in the Android SDK documentation\. These topics help you:
+ Create a project with AWS Amplify\.
+ Connect your app to the AWS features and resources that AWS Amplify supports\.

## Integrating the AWS Amplify JavaScript library<a name="integrate-sdk-amplify"></a>

To integrate AWS Amplify with your JavaScript application, see [Getting started \(JavaScript\)](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/js) or [Getting started \(React\)](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/react) in the AWS Amplify React documentation\. These topics help you:
+ Use command line tools and AWS Amplify to create a project\.
+ Create backend AWS resources for your application\.
+ Connect your app to the backend resources\.
+ Integrate the AWS Amplify library with your application\.

After you integrate AWS Amplify, return to this topic in the *Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide* for the next step\.

## Next step<a name="integrate-sdk-next"></a>

You've integrated AWS Amplify with your application\. Next, update your code to register your users' devices as endpoints\. See [Registering endpoints in your application](integrate-endpoints.md)\.
