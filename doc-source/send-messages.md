# Sending transactional messages from your apps<a name="send-messages"></a>

You can use the Amazon Pinpoint API and the AWS SDKs to send *transactional messages* directly from your apps\. Transactional messages are messages that you send to specific recipients, as opposed to messages that you send to segments\. There are several reasons that you might want to send transactional messages rather than campaign\-based messages\. For example, you can send an order confirmation by email when a customer places an order\. You could also send a one\-time password by SMS or voice that a customer can use to complete the process of creating an account for your service\.

This section includes example code in several programming languages that you can use to start sending transactional emails, SMS messages, and voice messages\.
