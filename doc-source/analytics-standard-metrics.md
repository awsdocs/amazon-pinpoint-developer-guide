# Standard Amazon Pinpoint analytics metrics<a name="analytics-standard-metrics"></a>

You can use Amazon Pinpoint Analytics APIs to query analytics data for a subset of standard metrics that apply to Amazon Pinpoint projects, campaigns, and journeys\. These metrics, also referred to as a *key performance indicators \(KPIs\)*, are measurable values that can help you monitor and assess the performance of projects, campaigns, and journeys\.

Amazon Pinpoint provides programmatic access to analytics data for several types of standard metrics:
+ **Application metrics** – These metrics provide insight into trends for all the campaigns and transactional messages that are associated with a project, also referred to as an *application*\. For example, you can use an application metric to get a breakdown of the number of messages that were opened by recipients for each campaign that's associated with a project\.
+ **Campaign metrics** – These metrics provide insight into the performance of individual campaigns\. For example, you can use a campaign metric to determine how many endpoints a campaign message was sent to or how many of those messages were delivered to endpoints\.
+ **Journey engagement metrics** – These metrics provide insight into the performance of individual journeys\. For example, you can use a journey engagement metric to get a breakdown of the number of messages that were opened by participants in each activity of a journey\.
+ **Journey execution metrics** – These metrics provide insight into participation trends for individual journeys\. For example, you can use a journey execution metric to determine how many participants started a journey\.
+ **Journey activity execution metrics** – These metrics provide insight into participation trends for individual activities in a journey\. For example, you can use a journey activity execution metric to determine how many participants started an activity and how many participants completed each path in an activity\.

The topics in this section list and describe the individual metrics that you can query for each type of metric\.

## Journey execution metrics<a name="journey-metrics-execution"></a>

The following table lists and describes standard execution metrics that you can query to assess the status of participants in an Amazon Pinpoint journey\. To query data for these metrics, use the [Journey execution metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/apireference/apps-application-id-journeys-journey-id-execution-metrics.html) resource of the Amazon Pinpoint API\. The **Field** column in the table identifies the name of the field that appears in the query results for each metric\. 


| Metric | Field | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  Active participants  |  `ENDPOINT_ACTIVE`  |  The number of participants who are actively proceeding through the activities in the journey\. This metric is calculated as the number of participants who started the journey, minus the number of participants who left the journey and the number of participants who were removed from the journey\.   | 
|  Participant cancellations  |  `CANCELLED`  |  The number of participants who didn't complete the journey because the journey was cancelled\.  | 
|  Participant departures  |  `ENDPOINT_LEFT`  |  The number of participants who left the journey\.  | 
|  Participant entries  |  `ENDPOINT_ENTERED`  |  The number of participants who started the journey\.  | 
|  Participant exceptions, reentry limits  |  `REENTRY_CAP_EXCEEDED`  |  The number of participants who didn't complete the journey because they would have exceeded the maximum number of times that a single participant can re\-enter the journey\.  | 
|  Participant exceptions, rejections  |  `ACTIVE_ENDPOINT_REJECTED`  |  The number of participants who can't start the journey because they are already active participants in the journey\. A participant is rejected if they start a journey and you subsequently update their endpoint definition in a way that affects their inclusion in a segment \(based on segment criteria\) or the journey \(based on activity conditions\)\.  | 

## Journey activity execution metrics<a name="journey-metrics-activity-execution"></a>

The following table lists and describes standard execution metrics that you can query to assess the status of participants in each type of individual activity for an Amazon Pinpoint journey\. To query data for these metrics, use the [Journey activity execution metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/apireference/apps-application-id-journeys-journey-id-activities-journey-activity-id-execution-metrics.html) resource of the Amazon Pinpoint API\. The **Metrics** column in the table lists the fields that appear in the query results for each type of activity\. It also provides a brief description of each field\.

Additional metrics are available for the activity on each path\. For information about those metrics, see the row in this table for that type of activity\.  | 
| Random split \(`RANDOM_SPLIT`\) |  For each path of the activity, the number of participants who proceeded to the activity on the path\. The query results for this metric are grouped by path, `Branch_#` where *\#* is the numeric identifier for a path—for example, `Branch_1` for the first path of the activity\. Additional metrics are available for the activity on each path\. For information about those metrics, see the row in this table for that type of activity\.  |
