# Creating segments<a name="segments"></a>

A user *segment* represents a subset of your users based on shared characteristics, such as how recently the users have used your app or which device platform they use\. A segment designates which users receive the messages delivered by a campaign\. Define segments so that you can reach the right audience when you want to invite users back to your app, make special offers, or otherwise increase user engagement and purchasing\.

After you create a segment, you can use it in one or more campaigns\. A campaign delivers tailored messages to the users in the segment\.
