# Infrastructure security in Amazon Pinpoint<a name="security-infrastructure-security"></a>

As a managed service, Amazon Pinpoint is protected by the AWS global network security procedures that are described in the [Amazon Web Services: Overview of security processes](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf) whitepaper\.

You use published AWS API calls to access Amazon Pinpoint through the network\. Clients must support Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) 1\.0 or later\. We recommend TLS 1\.2 or later\. Clients must also support cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy \(PFS\) such as Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman \(DHE\) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman \(ECDHE\)\. Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes\. 

Additionally, requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key that's associated with an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) principal for your AWS account\. Or you can use the [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) \(AWS STS\) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests\.

Although you can make these API calls from any network location, Amazon Pinpoint supports resource\-based access policies\. These policies can include restrictions based on source IP address\. To learn more about this type of policy, see [Managing access using policies](security-iam.md#security_iam_access-manage)\.

In addition, you can configure and use various AWS security features to control access to Amazon Pinpoint resources from any mobile or web apps that you integrate with Amazon Pinpoint\. This includes restrictions on API calls for tasks such as adding endpoints, updating endpoint data, submitting event data, and reporting usage data\. 

To use these features, we recommend that you use the AWS Mobile SDKs or AWS Amplify JavaScript libraries to integrate mobile and web apps with Amazon Pinpoint\. For Android or iOS apps, we recommend that you use the AWS Mobile SDK for Android or the AWS Mobile SDK for iOS, respectively\. For JavaScript\-based mobile or web apps, we recommend that you use the AWS Amplify JavaScript Library for the Web or the AWS Amplify JavaScript Library for React Native\. To learn more about these resources, see [Getting started with the AWS mobile SDKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-mobile/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html), [Getting started with the AWS Amplify library for the web](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-mobile/latest/developerguide/web-getting-started.html), and [Getting started with the AWS Amplify library for react native](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-mobile/latest/developerguide/react-native-getting-started.html)\.
